# 289CProj
This project is for the 289C Programming Languages and Compilers course.
For database-driven applications, efficient SQL query performance is essential. Poorly optimized queries can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, and many developers, especially those without extensive database expertise, write suboptimal SQL queries that result in slow execution times, unnecessary resource consumption, and scalability issues. While database optimizers can automatically refine some queries, they do not always catch high-level inefficiencies such as missing indices, redundant subqueries, or unnecessary full-table scans. 

There are many papers regarding SQL performance tuning, with previous studies focusing on cost-based query optimization (Graefe, 1993) and heuristic-based improvements (Chaudhuri, 1998). However, current approaches often require manual hands-on work, deep database expertise, or extensive profiling using EXPLAIN ANALYZE in PostgreSQL. Moreover, while tools like database advisors suggest indices or physical optimizations (Bruno and Chaudhuri, 2006), there is a gap in automated static analysis tools that provide real-time feedback on query inefficiencies before execution. 

The goal of this project is to bridge that gap by developing an automated static analysis tool for SQL query optimization in PostgreSQL. The tool will specifically target three common inefficiency categories: joins and filtering, query structure, and wildcard and string-matching. It will detect issues such as inefficient Cartesian joins, improper filtering order, unnecessary subqueries, misuse of SELECT *, redundant DISTINCT usage, and performance-degrading wildcard searches. By providing optimization suggestions, this system will help developers catch inefficient SQL queries early in the development cycle, reducing execution time and improving overall database efficiency. 

## Proposed Technical Approach
To properly evaluate this project, it must be tested on real SQL queries rather than LLM-generated queries that may or may not reflect those used in real-world applications. Real SQL queries may be found in open-source repositories such as GitHub or Kaggle, extracted from PostgreSQL logs using actual workloads, or scraped from public bug reports related to SQL performance issues (which may be an unlikely choice due to a potential increase in project scope). Once a dataset has been collected and defined, the tool will utilize the sqlparse Python library to parse SQL queries into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST will allow for the identification of query inefficiencies using rule-based heuristics. 

To assess the effectiveness of the optimization suggestions, PostgreSQL’s EXPLAIN ANALYZE will compare query execution plans before and after applying optimization patterns. In PostgreSQL, "EXPLAIN ANALYZE" is a command that not only displays the execution plan for a given SQL query, but also runs the query and provides detailed information about its real execution time, row counts, and costs at each step. Additionally, a potential extension of this project could involve implementing a cost model to estimate performance improvements, providing developers with a quantitative assessment of the optimization’s impact. Finally, the tool will generate human-readable feedback for the detected inefficiencies, ensuring developers receive clear insights into the query optimization.
